# Predicted Economics Paper 1 Questions: Your Monday Exam Forecast

Your A-level Economics Paper 1 exam on Monday will test your microeconomic knowledge across Theme 1 (Markets and Market Failure) and Theme 3 (Business Behaviour and the Labour Market). Based on thorough analysis of recent exams, recurring patterns, and current economic events, these are the most likely question topics and specific predictions for what you'll face.

## Recent past papers reveal clear patterns

Edexcel's Paper 1 follows a consistent structure: 100 marks split across three sections, with 2 hours to complete. Section A (25 marks) features multiple choice and short answer questions. Section B (50 marks) presents data response questions on real-world scenarios. Section C (25 marks) offers a choice between two extended essays. 

Recent exams show significant focus on **market structures** (particularly monopoly and oligopoly), **externalities**, and **government intervention**. The 2023-2024 papers emphasized environmental market failures, digital markets, and the effectiveness of competition policy. Essays have consistently examined monopoly regulation, oligopoly behavior, and market failure remedies.

Recent assessments have increasingly focused on **application to real-world scenarios**, stronger emphasis on **evaluation throughout responses**, and integration of **appropriate diagrams** with written analysis.

## Theme 1 topics most likely to appear Monday

Theme 1 coverage has shown particular emphasis on these high-frequency topics:

1. **Elasticity concepts** (price, income, cross) - Frequently tested through calculation questions and analysis of revenue implications. Examiners particularly value application to real-world contexts.

2. **Market failure - externalities** - Consistently appears in both data response and essay sections, with recent focus on environmental externalities and public health issues.

3. **Government intervention** - Evaluation of different policy approaches to market failure, with emphasis on comparing market-based and regulatory solutions.

4. **Public goods and information asymmetry** - These appear with moderate frequency but haven't been tested in depth recently, making them prime candidates for Monday.

## Theme 3 topics most likely to appear Monday

Theme 3 assessment patterns reveal these key areas:

1. **Oligopoly behavior** - Consistently tested through application of game theory, analysis of interdependence, and evaluation of collusion versus competition.

2. **Market structure efficiency comparisons** - Questions requiring analysis of efficiency differences between perfect competition, monopolistic competition, and monopoly.

3. **Competition policy** - Evaluation of government intervention in monopoly and oligopoly markets has featured prominently.

4. **Labour market analysis** - Wage determination and minimum wage impacts have appeared consistently, with recent focus on post-pandemic labour market changes.

## Economic events that will likely frame Monday's questions

Several recent economic developments provide excellent application contexts for Monday's exam:

1. **Digital market regulation** - The UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act implemented in January 2025 created a new framework for regulating tech giants, providing a perfect case study for monopoly/oligopoly questions.

2. **Energy market price volatility** - Continued price fluctuations throughout 2024-2025 offer rich context for elasticity, market intervention, and welfare analysis questions.

3. **Carbon pricing mechanisms** - The UK Emissions Trading System (ETS) experienced significant price fluctuations in 2024, offering excellent application for externality and government intervention questions.

4. **Post-pandemic labour market adjustments** - The UK labour market has shown interesting shifts: unemployment remains low (4.4%), but economic inactivity rates have increased due to long-term sickness, creating excellent context for labour market questions.

5. **Tech sector antitrust cases** - Major rulings against Google, Meta, and Apple provide contemporary examples for questions on market power and competition policy.

## Predicted questions for Theme 1

### 10-mark questions:

1. **"Evaluate the view that information asymmetry causes more significant market failure than negative externalities."** 
   *Rationale: Information asymmetry hasn't been tested in depth recently, making it due for assessment. This question requires comparison of different market failures.*

2. **"Assess the effectiveness of tradable permits in reducing carbon emissions compared to direct regulation."**
   *Rationale: Environmental market failures feature prominently, and the UK ETS provides contemporary application. This question combines market failure with government intervention evaluation.*

3. **"Using examples, evaluate the significance of cross-price elasticity of demand for business decision-making."**
   *Rationale: Elasticity questions appear consistently. This question requires application to business contexts, bridging Themes 1 and 3.*

### 25-mark questions:

1. **"Discuss the view that government failure is inevitable when attempting to correct market failures."** 
   *Rationale: Government intervention effectiveness is a recurring theme. This question requires evaluation of different policy approaches and their limitations.*

2. **"Evaluate the extent to which the provision of public goods should be left to the private sector."**
   *Rationale: Public goods haven't been assessed in depth recently. The question allows for application to contemporary issues like digital infrastructure.*

## Predicted questions for Theme 3

### 10-mark questions:

1. **"Evaluate how the imposition of price caps in energy markets affects producer and consumer welfare."**
   *Rationale: Energy market intervention provides contemporary context for price control analysis, combining theoretical understanding with real-world application.*

2. **"Assess the extent to which non-price competition benefits consumers in oligopolistic markets."**
   *Rationale: Oligopoly behavior is frequently tested. This question requires analysis of different competitive strategies.*

3. **"Evaluate how the minimum wage affects different stakeholders in the UK labour market."**
   *Rationale: Labour market analysis appears consistently, with minimum wage impacts providing rich evaluation opportunities.*

### 25-mark questions:

1. **"Discuss the view that digital markets are best regulated through competition policy rather than direct intervention."**
   *Rationale: Digital market regulation is highly topical with the recent DMCC Act. This question allows for evaluation of different regulatory approaches.*

2. **"Evaluate the extent to which a firm's objectives determine its pricing and output decisions."**
   *Rationale: Business objectives beyond profit maximization haven't been tested extensively recently. This question bridges theoretical models with real-world business behavior.*

## How to approach different question types

### For 10-mark questions:
- You have 10 minutes (1 minute per mark)
- Focus on **two well-developed points** with evaluation for each
- Structure: Point 1 → Evaluation 1 → Point 2 → Evaluation 2
- Integrate a relevant diagram that supports your analysis
- Use real-world examples to strengthen application
- No conclusion needed for 10-mark questions

### For 25-mark essay questions:
- Allow 30 minutes total (including 2-3 minutes planning)
- Structure: Introduction → Analysis point 1 → Evaluation 1 → Analysis point 2 → Evaluation 2 → Conclusion
- **Diagrams are essential** - ensure they're accurately drawn and fully labeled
- Aim for **depth rather than breadth** - 2-3 well-developed points with thorough evaluation
- Make a **justified judgment** in your conclusion that directly answers the question
- **Balance KAA (16 marks) and evaluation (9 marks)** throughout your response

## Common mistakes to avoid in Paper 1

1. **Diagram errors**: Incorrect shifts of curves, missing labels, or failing to show equilibrium points. Practice drawing key diagrams from memory before Monday.

2. **Poor application**: Generic responses without reference to the specific context. Always use information from extracts or apply to real-world examples.

3. **Time mismanagement**: Spending too long on lower-mark questions. Stick rigidly to timing: 30 minutes for Section A, 60 minutes for Section B, 30 minutes for Section C.

4. **Weak evaluation**: Superficial points without development. Ensure evaluation considers different perspectives, magnitudes, time frames, and specific contexts.

5. **Calculation errors**: Especially in elasticity questions. Double-check your working and interpretations of values.

6. **Theme-specific mistakes**:
   - **Theme 1**: Confusing types of market failure or misapplying government interventions
   - **Theme 3**: Confusing market structure characteristics or drawing incorrect cost/revenue curves

## Final exam day preparation

1. **Review key diagrams** for both themes - especially externality diagrams, market structure comparisons, and labour market models.

2. **Prepare 3-4 contemporary examples** that can be applied across different questions - the digital markets regulation, energy price volatility, and carbon pricing are versatile options.

3. **Memorize evaluation frameworks** for common topics - particularly for market structures comparison, government intervention effectiveness, and wage determination.

4. **Practice timing with past questions** - even 10-15 minute sessions on individual questions help build time management skills.

5. **If you blank during the exam**, focus on applying the fundamental economic concepts: efficiency, welfare analysis, incentives, and market power. 

Remember that examiners reward economic reasoning and application more than memorized content. Focus on demonstrating your ability to think like an economist, apply concepts to real situations, and evaluate different perspectives.

Good luck on Monday!
