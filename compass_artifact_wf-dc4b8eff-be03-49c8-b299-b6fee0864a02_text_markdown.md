# 50 Expert Python Debugging and Performance Questions

This collection contains 50 medium to expert-level Python debugging, troubleshooting, and performance tuning questions with answers from GitHub, HackerRank, and Turing.com. The questions cover various Python topics from memory management to asyncio debugging.

## 1. Memory Management and Optimization

### 1.1 Memory Profiling with Memray

**Problem Statement:**
Identifying the source of high memory usage in Python applications is challenging, especially when C extensions are involved. How can you accurately track memory allocations across both Python code and native extensions?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Without proper memory profiling, memory issues in this code are hard to detect
def process_data(data):
    # Some processing that might cause memory leaks
    result = [complex_calculation(x) for x in data]
    # More processing
    return final_transformation(result)
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
# Using Bloomberg's Memray for memory profiling
# Install with: pip install memray
# Basic usage:
# python -m memray run my_script.py
# python -m memray flamegraph memray-my_script.*.bin

# In your code, you can also use it programmatically:
import memray

with memray.Tracker("output.bin"):
    process_data(large_dataset)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not tracking memory usage in C extensions
- Using memory profilers that only track Python objects
- Profiling the wrong parts of the application
- Not correlating memory usage with specific functions

**Performance Implications:**
While Memray adds some overhead, it's designed to be fast with minimal impact on application performance. Native code tracking is somewhat slower but can be toggled on/off as needed.

### 1.2 Detecting Memory Leaks with Pympler

**Problem Statement:**
Memory leaks in long-running Python applications can be difficult to detect and diagnose. How can you identify objects that are not being properly garbage collected?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
cache = {}

def process_item(item_id, data):
    # Process the data
    result = expensive_computation(data)
    # Store in cache without any size limits
    cache[item_id] = result
    return result
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
from pympler import tracker

# Track memory usage
memory_tracker = tracker.SummaryTracker()

# Create a bounded cache with size limit
class LimitedCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size=1000):
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_size = max_size
    
    def add(self, key, value):
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            # Remove oldest item
            self.cache.pop(next(iter(self.cache)))
        self.cache[key] = value
    
    def get(self, key):
        return self.cache.get(key)

# Usage
cache = LimitedCache()

def process_item(item_id, data):
    result = expensive_computation(data)
    cache.add(item_id, result)
    return result

# Check memory growth
memory_tracker.print_diff()
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not setting limits on caches or collections
- Circular references that prevent garbage collection
- Not using weak references when appropriate
- Storing large objects in global variables

**Performance Implications:**
Unbounded caches can lead to memory leaks and eventual out-of-memory errors. Using a bounded cache with size limits prevents uncontrolled memory growth while still providing performance benefits.

### 1.3 Understanding Python's Memory Management

**Problem Statement:**
Explain how Python manages memory internally and how reference counting impacts your code's performance.

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def process_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        # This loads the entire file into memory
        data = f.read()
        
    # Process the data
    lines = data.split('\n')
    result = [process_line(line) for line in lines]
    return result
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def process_large_file(filename):
    results = []
    # Process the file line by line without loading it all at once
    with open(filename) as f:
        for line in f:
            results.append(process_line(line.strip()))
    return results
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Loading entire large files into memory
- Creating unnecessary copies of large data structures
- Not understanding how reference counting works
- Misunderstanding Python's memory allocation strategy

**Performance Implications:**
The memory-efficient solution processes data incrementally, which minimizes memory usage and makes it possible to handle files of any size, whereas the original solution would run out of memory for very large files.

## 2. Concurrency Issues (Threading, Multiprocessing)

### 2.1 Understanding the GIL and Its Limitations

**Problem Statement:**
Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. How does this affect your choice of concurrency model?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
import threading

def cpu_bound_task(data):
    # Computationally intensive processing
    result = [x**2 for x in range(data)]
    return result

# Trying to speed up CPU-bound task with threading
threads = []
for i in range(4):
    t = threading.Thread(target=cpu_bound_task, args=(1000000,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import multiprocessing

def cpu_bound_task(data):
    # Computationally intensive processing
    result = [x**2 for x in range(data)]
    return result

# Using multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
processes = []
for i in range(4):
    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=cpu_bound_task, args=(1000000,))
    processes.append(p)
    p.start()

for p in processes:
    p.join()
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using threading for CPU-bound tasks
- Not understanding the GIL's impact on threaded code
- Creating too many processes without considering memory overhead
- Not accounting for process startup time

**Performance Implications:**
For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing can utilize multiple CPU cores and achieve true parallelism, while threading will be limited by the GIL and may not provide significant speedup.

### 2.2 Thread Safety and Race Conditions

**Problem Statement:**
Concurrent access to shared resources can lead to race conditions and data corruption. How do you ensure thread safety in Python?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
counter = 0

def increment_counter():
    global counter
    # This is not atomic and can lead to race conditions
    counter += 1

# Create threads
threads = []
for _ in range(100):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(f"Counter: {counter}")  # May not be 100
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment_counter():
    global counter
    with lock:
        counter += 1

# Create threads
threads = []
for _ in range(100):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment_counter)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(f"Counter: {counter}")  # Will be 100
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not using locks for shared resource access
- Using too fine-grained locks leading to deadlocks
- Not considering that operations may not be atomic
- Over-synchronizing, which reduces concurrency

**Performance Implications:**
Proper synchronization ensures data consistency but can reduce concurrency. Finding the right balance between thread safety and performance is crucial.

### 2.3 Deadlock Detection and Prevention

**Problem Statement:**
How do you detect and prevent deadlocks in multithreaded Python applications?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
import threading

lock1 = threading.Lock()
lock2 = threading.Lock()

def thread1_function():
    with lock1:
        # Do something
        import time
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Increase chance of deadlock
        with lock2:
            # Use both resources
            pass

def thread2_function():
    with lock2:
        # Do something
        import time
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Increase chance of deadlock
        with lock1:
            # Use both resources
            pass

t1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1_function)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2_function)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import threading

# Define a consistent lock acquisition order
lock1 = threading.Lock()
lock2 = threading.Lock()

def thread1_function():
    with lock1:
        # Do something
        with lock2:
            # Use both resources
            pass

def thread2_function():
    # Always acquire locks in the same order
    with lock1:
        # Do something
        with lock2:
            # Use both resources
            pass

t1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1_function)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2_function)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Acquiring locks in inconsistent orders
- Not using timeout-based lock acquisition
- Not having a deadlock detection strategy
- Creating complex lock hierarchies

**Performance Implications:**
Deadlocks can completely halt application execution. Preventing them may require careful design but is essential for reliable multithreaded applications.

## 3. Profiling and Benchmarking

### 3.1 CPU Profiling with cProfile

**Problem Statement:**
How can you identify performance bottlenecks in Python code?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def process_data(data):
    results = []
    for item in data:
        result = complex_calculation(item)
        results.append(result)
    return results

def complex_calculation(item):
    # Potentially slow operations
    for i in range(1000):
        item = item * 1.1
    return item

# No profiling, can't identify bottlenecks
process_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import cProfile
import pstats
from pstats import SortKey

def process_data(data):
    results = []
    for item in data:
        result = complex_calculation(item)
        results.append(result)
    return results

def complex_calculation(item):
    # Potentially slow operations
    for i in range(1000):
        item = item * 1.1
    return item

# Profile the function
cProfile.run('process_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])', 'profile_output')

# Analyze the results
p = pstats.Stats('profile_output')
p.strip_dirs().sort_stats(SortKey.CUMULATIVE).print_stats(10)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not profiling code before optimizing
- Profiling the wrong sections of code
- Misinterpreting profiling results
- Optimizing based on assumptions rather than measurements

**Performance Implications:**
Profiling helps identify the actual bottlenecks in code, allowing targeted optimizations that give the most significant performance improvements.

### 3.2 Memory Profiling Line-by-Line

**Problem Statement:**
How can you identify which specific lines of code consume the most memory?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def memory_intensive_function():
    # Which parts use the most memory?
    a = [1] * (10 ** 6)
    b = [2] * (2 * 10 ** 7)
    c = a + b
    return c
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
# Install with: pip install memory_profiler
from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def memory_intensive_function():
    a = [1] * (10 ** 6)  # Line 4
    b = [2] * (2 * 10 ** 7)  # Line 5
    c = a + b  # Line 6
    return c  # Line 7

# Call the function
memory_intensive_function()

# Output will show memory usage per line:
# Line #    Mem usage    Increment  Occurrences   Line Contents
# =============================================================
#      4     30.5 MB      0.0 MB           1   def memory_intensive_function():
#      5     38.1 MB      7.6 MB           1       a = [1] * (10 ** 6)
#      6    190.7 MB    152.6 MB           1       b = [2] * (2 * 10 ** 7)
#      7    343.3 MB    152.6 MB           1       c = a + b
#      8    343.3 MB      0.0 MB           1       return c
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not measuring memory usage at a granular level
- Attributing memory usage to the wrong operations
- Not considering temporary objects created during operations
- Ignoring memory leaked due to reference cycles

**Performance Implications:**
Memory profiling significantly slows down execution but provides valuable insights for memory optimization. Use it for targeted debugging rather than in production.

### 3.3 Time Complexity: Primality Challenge

**Problem Statement:**
Determine whether a number is prime in optimal time.

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def is_prime(n):
    # Inefficient O(n) approach
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    # More efficient O(sqrt(n)) approach
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check from 5 to sqrt(n)
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Checking all numbers from 2 to n-1 (O(n) time complexity)
- Not considering early exit conditions
- Not recognizing that we only need to check divisors up to √n
- Not using patterns to skip numbers that can't be prime

**Performance Implications:**
The optimization reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(√n), which is a significant improvement for large numbers. For a number like 1,000,000, the original approach would check up to 999,999 potential divisors, while the optimized approach checks only up to 1,000 divisors.

## 4. Common Python Bottlenecks and How to Address Them

### 4.1 Inefficient Data Structures

**Problem Statement:**
Using inappropriate data structures can lead to poor performance. How can you optimize data structure selection?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Inefficient: Searching in a list is O(n)
def contains_value(value, collection):
    return value in collection  # O(n) for lists

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(contains_value(7, my_list))
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
# Efficient: Searching in a set is O(1)
def contains_value(value, collection):
    return value in collection  # O(1) for sets

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
print(contains_value(7, my_set))
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using lists for frequent lookups by value
- Using dictionaries for ordered data (pre-Python 3.7)
- Using tuples for mutable collections
- Not considering the time complexity of operations

**Performance Implications:**
Using appropriate data structures can dramatically improve performance. For example, membership testing in sets and dictionaries is O(1) compared to O(n) for lists.

### 4.2 String Concatenation in Loops

**Problem Statement:**
Repeated string concatenations create many temporary objects, leading to performance issues.

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def build_large_string(n):
    result = ""
    for i in range(n):
        result += str(i)  # Creates many temporary strings
    return result

# This gets increasingly slow as n grows
large_string = build_large_string(100000)
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def build_large_string(n):
    # Use join() for efficient string concatenation
    return "".join(str(i) for i in range(n))

# Much faster, especially for large n
large_string = build_large_string(100000)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using += for string concatenation in loops
- Not understanding string immutability in Python
- Creating unnecessary intermediate strings
- Not using StringIO for complex string building

**Performance Implications:**
The efficient version can be 10-100x faster and uses significantly less memory for large strings, as it avoids creating many temporary string objects.

### 4.3 Using NumPy for Numerical Operations

**Problem Statement:**
Pure Python operations on numerical data are slow. How can you optimize numerical computations?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    # Pure Python calculations
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate variance
    squared_diff_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        squared_diff_sum += (num - mean) ** 2
    variance = squared_diff_sum / len(numbers)
    
    # Calculate standard deviation
    std_dev = variance ** 0.5
    
    return mean, variance, std_dev
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    # Convert to NumPy array once
    arr = np.array(numbers)
    
    # Vectorized calculations
    mean = np.mean(arr)
    variance = np.var(arr)
    std_dev = np.std(arr)
    
    return mean, variance, std_dev
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using Python loops for numerical operations
- Not leveraging vectorized operations
- Converting between NumPy arrays and Python lists unnecessarily
- Not using specialized libraries for numerical computations

**Performance Implications:**
NumPy operations can be 10-100x faster than equivalent Python loops for numerical computations, especially for large datasets.

## 5. Debugging Complex Python Applications

### 5.1 Using Python Debugger (pdb)

**Problem Statement:**
Debugging complex applications requires interactive inspection capabilities. How can you use Python's built-in debugger effectively?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def complex_function(data):
    # Many operations, hard to debug with print statements
    processed = preprocess(data)
    intermediate = transform(processed)
    result = finalize(intermediate)
    return result

# Hard to see what's happening inside
complex_function(my_data)
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import pdb

def complex_function(data):
    processed = preprocess(data)
    
    # Set a breakpoint to inspect state
    pdb.set_trace()  # Python 2 and 3
    # Or in Python 3.7+: breakpoint()
    
    intermediate = transform(processed)
    result = finalize(intermediate)
    return result
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Overreliance on print debugging
- Not using debugger features like variable inspection
- Not understanding debugger commands
- Setting breakpoints in the wrong places

**Performance Implications:**
While debugging adds overhead during development, it significantly reduces the time needed to identify and fix issues, leading to better code quality and performance.

### 5.2 Memory-Based Breakpoints

**Problem Statement:**
Debugging memory issues requires stopping execution when memory usage exceeds a threshold.

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def process_batch(items):
    results = []
    for item in items:
        # May cause memory growth, but hard to debug
        result = process_item(item)
        results.append(result)
    return results
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
# Run with: python -m memory_profiler --pdb-mmem=100 my_script.py
# This will drop into a debugger when memory usage exceeds 100MB

from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def process_batch(items):
    results = []
    for item in items:
        result = process_item(item)
        results.append(result)
        # Can monitor memory growth during execution
    return results
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not monitoring memory usage during execution
- Not setting memory thresholds for detection
- Not understanding memory growth patterns
- Waiting for out-of-memory errors to occur

**Performance Implications:**
Memory-based breakpoints add overhead to monitor memory usage during execution but can help catch memory issues before they cause application crashes.

### 5.3 Debugging with Logging

**Problem Statement:**
How can you effectively use logging for debugging complex applications?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def complex_process(data):
    # No visibility into execution
    step1 = process_step1(data)
    step2 = process_step2(step1)
    step3 = process_step3(step2)
    return step3
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    filename='app.log'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def complex_process(data):
    logger.debug(f"Starting process with data: {data[:100]}...")
    
    step1 = process_step1(data)
    logger.debug(f"After step1, result length: {len(step1)}")
    
    step2 = process_step2(step1)
    logger.debug(f"After step2, result type: {type(step2)}")
    
    step3 = process_step3(step2)
    logger.debug(f"Process completed, final result: {step3[:100]}...")
    
    return step3
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using print statements instead of proper logging
- Not configuring appropriate log levels
- Logging too much or too little information
- Not using structured logging for complex applications

**Performance Implications:**
Properly configured logging has minimal impact in production but provides invaluable information for debugging. Using log levels appropriately ensures you get the right information when needed.

## 6. Identifying and Fixing Memory Leaks

### 6.1 Using tracemalloc

**Problem Statement:**
Memory leaks are difficult to pinpoint to specific lines of code. How can you trace memory allocations to their source?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Memory leak: growing list that's never cleared
global_cache = []

def process_item(item):
    # Process the item
    result = item * 2
    # Add to global cache but never clean it
    global_cache.append(result)
    return result
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()

# Use a bounded cache instead
class BoundedCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size=1000):
        self.items = []
        self.max_size = max_size
    
    def add(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
        if len(self.items) > self.max_size:
            self.items.pop(0)  # Remove oldest item

# Create a bounded cache
global_cache = BoundedCache()

def process_item(item):
    result = item * 2
    global_cache.add(result)
    return result

# Process some items
for i in range(10000):
    process_item(i)

# Take a snapshot and get statistics
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')
print("\n".join(str(stat) for stat in top_stats[:10]))
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not tracking memory allocations
- Global variables growing without bounds
- Circular references containing objects with __del__ methods
- Not using weak references when appropriate

**Performance Implications:**
Memory leaks can cause applications to slow down and eventually crash. Proper tracking and bounded collections help maintain consistent memory usage.

### 6.2 Addressing Memory Fragmentation

**Problem Statement:**
Python's memory manager may not return memory to the operating system, leading to high memory usage. How can you address this issue?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def process_large_batches(data_generator):
    for batch in data_generator:
        # Process each large batch
        results = []
        for item in batch:
            result = process_item(item)
            results.append(result)
        
        # Memory might not be released back to OS
        yield results
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def process_large_batches(data_generator):
    for batch in data_generator:
        # Process each item individually and yield
        # to avoid building large intermediate lists
        for item in batch:
            yield process_item(item)
        
        # Force garbage collection after each batch
        import gc
        gc.collect()
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Creating large intermediate data structures
- Not forcing garbage collection when appropriate
- Not using generators for large data processing
- Not considering memory fragmentation

**Performance Implications:**
Memory fragmentation can lead to higher memory usage than necessary. Periodic garbage collection and avoiding large intermediate structures can help manage memory effectively.

### 6.3 Using Weak References

**Problem Statement:**
How can weak references help prevent memory leaks in Python applications?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Cache that keeps strong references to all objects
cache = {}

def get_data(key):
    if key not in cache:
        data = fetch_expensive_data(key)
        cache[key] = data
    return cache[key]
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import weakref

# Cache with weak references that don't prevent garbage collection
cache = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()

def get_data(key):
    # Try to get from cache, returns None if object has been collected
    result = cache.get(key)
    if result is None:
        data = fetch_expensive_data(key)
        cache[key] = data
        return data
    return result
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using strong references when weak references would be appropriate
- Not understanding how weak references work
- Not considering object lifecycle
- Creating reference cycles that prevent garbage collection

**Performance Implications:**
Weak references allow objects to be garbage collected when they're no longer used elsewhere, preventing memory leaks while still providing caching benefits.

## 7. Performance Issues with Data Structures and Algorithms

### 7.1 Generator Expressions vs. List Comprehensions

**Problem Statement:**
List comprehensions can consume excessive memory for large datasets. When should you use generator expressions instead?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def process_large_dataset(data):
    # List comprehension loads entire result into memory
    squared = [x * x for x in data]
    
    # Process the squared values
    result = sum(squared) / len(squared)
    return result
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def process_large_dataset(data):
    # Generator expression produces values on demand
    squared = (x * x for x in data)
    
    # Process values without storing them all
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for value in squared:
        total += value
        count += 1
    
    result = total / count if count > 0 else 0
    return result
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using list comprehensions for large datasets
- Creating unnecessary intermediate lists
- Not leveraging generators for memory efficiency
- Converting generators to lists unnecessarily

**Performance Implications:**
Generator expressions are more memory-efficient, especially for large datasets, as they produce values on demand without loading all results into memory at once.

### 7.2 Creating Custom Iterators

**Problem Statement:**
Need to implement custom iterable objects with specific behavior.

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Inefficient implementation: loads all Fibonacci numbers into a list
def fibonacci_list(limit):
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(limit):
        result.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return result

# Usage - consumes memory proportional to limit
for num in fibonacci_list(1000000):
    process(num)
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
class Fibonacci:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.a, self.b = 0, 1
        self.count = 0
        
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
        
    def __next__(self):
        if self.count >= self.limit:
            raise StopIteration
        result = self.a
        self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b
        self.count += 1
        return result

# Usage - constant memory usage regardless of limit
for num in Fibonacci(1000000):
    process(num)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Generating all values upfront instead of lazily
- Not implementing the iterator protocol correctly
- Confusing iterators and iterables
- Not handling StopIteration properly

**Performance Implications:**
Custom iterators avoid loading all data into memory at once, enabling efficient processing of large or infinite sequences with constant memory usage.

### 7.3 Optimizing Search Performance

**Problem Statement:**
Optimize a searching algorithm for a large sorted array to find elements in logarithmic time instead of linear time.

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def find_element(arr, x):
    # Linear search: O(n)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def find_element(arr, x):
    # Binary search: O(log n)
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # Avoids potential overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return -1
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using linear search when binary search would be more efficient
- Not considering the properties of the data (sorted vs. unsorted)
- Calculating the middle index in a way that could cause integer overflow
- Not handling edge cases correctly

**Performance Implications:**
The performance difference between linear and binary search is dramatic for large datasets. For an array of 1 million elements, linear search might take up to 1 million comparisons, while binary search would need at most 20 comparisons.

## 8. Optimizing Database Interactions and Network Calls

### 8.1 Connection Pooling for Databases

**Problem Statement:**
Creating database connections is expensive. How can you optimize database connection management?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Creating a new connection for each database operation
def get_user(user_id):
    conn = create_database_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    return result
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool

# Create an engine with connection pooling
engine = create_engine(
    'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydatabase', 
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=5, 
    max_overflow=10
)

def get_user(user_id):
    # Connection is automatically returned to the pool when closed
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        result = conn.execute(
            "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,)
        ).fetchone()
    return result
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Creating new connections for each database operation
- Not using connection pooling
- Not closing connections properly
- Setting inappropriate pool sizes

**Performance Implications:**
Connection pooling can dramatically improve performance by reusing database connections, avoiding the overhead of establishing new connections for each operation.

### 8.2 Batching Database Operations

**Problem Statement:**
Making many small database queries is inefficient. How can you optimize database access patterns?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Inefficient: One query per item
def update_user_statuses(user_ids, new_status):
    for user_id in user_ids:
        execute_query(
            "UPDATE users SET status = %s WHERE id = %s",
            (new_status, user_id)
        )
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
# Efficient: Batch update
def update_user_statuses(user_ids, new_status):
    placeholders = ', '.join(['%s'] * len(user_ids))
    params = [new_status] * len(user_ids)
    params.extend(user_ids)
    
    execute_query(
        f"UPDATE users SET status = %s WHERE id IN ({placeholders})",
        params
    )
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using a separate query for each operation
- Not leveraging database-specific batch operations
- Making too many small transactions
- Not using parameterized queries

**Performance Implications:**
Batching database operations can improve throughput by orders of magnitude, reducing network latency and database overhead.

### 8.3 Optimizing ORM Usage

**Problem Statement:**
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like SQLAlchemy can introduce performance overhead. How can you optimize ORM usage?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Inefficient ORM usage: N+1 query problem
def get_users_with_posts():
    users = session.query(User).all()
    
    # This causes a separate query for each user
    for user in users:
        posts = user.posts  # Lazy loading triggers a query
        process_user_posts(user, posts)
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
# Efficient ORM usage with eager loading
def get_users_with_posts():
    # Single query with a join
    users = session.query(User).options(
        joinedload(User.posts)
    ).all()
    
    # No additional queries needed
    for user in users:
        process_user_posts(user, user.posts)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not understanding lazy vs. eager loading
- The N+1 query problem (loading related objects one by one)
- Not using appropriate loading strategies
- Not optimizing query patterns for specific use cases

**Performance Implications:**
Proper ORM usage can provide the convenience of working with objects while maintaining good performance. Eager loading can reduce the number of database queries from N+1 to just 1.

## 9. Generator Expressions and Iterators

### 9.1 Efficient Data Processing with Generators

**Problem Statement:**
How can generators be used to process large datasets efficiently?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def process_log_file(filename):
    # Load entire file into memory
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    # Process all lines at once
    errors = [line for line in lines if 'ERROR' in line]
    warnings = [line for line in lines if 'WARNING' in line]
    
    return {
        'error_count': len(errors),
        'warning_count': len(warnings),
        'error_lines': errors,
        'warning_lines': warnings
    }
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def process_log_file(filename):
    # Counter function to avoid storing all matching lines
    def count_and_collect(iterable, keyword, max_collect=100):
        count = 0
        collected = []
        for item in iterable:
            if keyword in item:
                count += 1
                if len(collected) < max_collect:
                    collected.append(item)
        return count, collected
    
    # Process file line by line without loading it all
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        # Create a line generator
        lines = (line for line in f)
        
        # First pass for errors
        error_count, error_lines = count_and_collect(lines, 'ERROR')
        
        # Reopen file for second pass
        f.seek(0)
        lines = (line for line in f)
        warning_count, warning_lines = count_and_collect(lines, 'WARNING')
    
    return {
        'error_count': error_count,
        'warning_count': warning_count,
        'error_lines': error_lines,
        'warning_lines': warning_lines
    }
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Loading entire files into memory
- Creating multiple lists of filtered data
- Not using generators for streams of data
- Processing data in multiple passes when one pass would suffice

**Performance Implications:**
Generator-based processing allows handling files of any size with constant memory usage, whereas loading everything into memory would fail for very large files.

### 9.2 Combining Generators with itertools

**Problem Statement:**
How can you use Python's itertools to perform complex operations on data streams efficiently?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Inefficient: Creates multiple intermediate lists
def find_common_elements(list1, list2, list3):
    # Find elements common to all lists
    common = []
    for item in list1:
        if item in list2 and item in list3:
            common.append(item)
    return common
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
from itertools import chain

def find_common_elements(list1, list2, list3):
    # Convert lists to sets for O(1) lookups
    set2, set3 = set(list2), set(list3)
    
    # Use generator expression for memory efficiency
    return (item for item in list1 if item in set2 and item in set3)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not using appropriate itertools functions
- Creating unnecessary intermediate collections
- Multiple passes over the same data
- Not leveraging the efficiency of itertools functions

**Performance Implications:**
The itertools module provides memory-efficient, high-performance tools for working with iterators. Using them properly can significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance.

### 9.3 Generator Functions for Complex Iteration

**Problem Statement:**
Complex iteration patterns are hard to express with standard loops. How can you use generator functions to simplify them?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Complex, hard-to-understand iteration
def traverse_tree(root):
    # Manual recursion with explicit stack management
    result = []
    stack = [root]
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        result.append(node.value)
        for child in reversed(node.children):
            stack.append(child)
    return result
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def traverse_tree(node):
    """Generate all nodes in a tree using depth-first traversal."""
    yield node.value
    for child in node.children:
        # Recursively yield from child traversals
        yield from traverse_tree(child)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Implementing complex iteration patterns manually
- Not using yield and yield from for recursive traversals
- Creating intermediate collections instead of yielding values
- Not leveraging the power of generator functions for complex iterations

**Performance Implications:**
Generators maintain their state between calls, making complex iteration patterns memory-efficient and easier to express.

## 10. Metaprogramming Debugging Problems

### 10.1 Debugging Decorators

**Problem Statement:**
Decorators can obscure function metadata and make debugging difficult. How can you write debuggable decorators?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        """Wrapper function"""
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def greet(name):
    """Say hello to someone"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# The decorated function loses its metadata
print(greet.__name__)  # Prints "wrapper" instead of "greet"
print(greet.__doc__)   # Prints "Wrapper function" instead of the original docstring
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)  # Preserves original function metadata
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def greet(name):
    """Say hello to someone"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# The decorated function retains its metadata
print(greet.__name__)  # Prints "greet"
print(greet.__doc__)   # Prints "Say hello to someone"
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not using functools.wraps
- Lost function metadata making debugging difficult
- Nested decorators causing confusion
- Decorators that modify function behavior in confusing ways

**Performance Implications:**
While functools.wraps adds minimal overhead, it significantly improves debuggability by preserving the original function's metadata.

### 10.2 Inspecting the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

**Problem Statement:**
Understanding complex metaprogramming code requires inspecting how Python parses code. How can you use the AST module for debugging?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Complex code with multiple nested function calls
expression = "func1(func2(x), func3(y, z))"

# Hard to understand the structure without execution
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import ast

# Parse the expression into an AST
tree = ast.parse(expression)

# Print the AST structure
print(ast.dump(tree, indent=4))

# Output will show the parsed structure:
# Module(
#     body=[
#         Expr(
#             value=Call(
#                 func=Name(id='func1', ctx=Load()),
#                 args=[
#                     Call(
#                         func=Name(id='func2', ctx=Load()),
#                         args=[Name(id='x', ctx=Load())],
#                         keywords=[]
#                     ),
#                     Call(
#                         func=Name(id='func3', ctx=Load()),
#                         args=[
#                             Name(id='y', ctx=Load()),
#                             Name(id='z', ctx=Load())
#                         ],
#                         keywords=[]
#                     )
#                 ],
#                 keywords=[]
#             )
#         )
#     ],
#     type_ignores=[]
# )
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not using appropriate tools to understand code structure
- Trying to debug complex metaprogramming manually
- Not visualizing the AST when working with code that generates code
- Missing the structure of nested expressions

**Performance Implications:**
AST inspection is generally done for debugging and understanding code, not during normal execution, so its performance impact is limited to development time.

### 10.3 Debugging Dynamic Attribute Access

**Problem Statement:**
Dynamic attribute access through __getattr__ and similar methods can make debugging difficult. How can you trace attribute access in Python?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
class DynamicAttributes:
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        # Dynamically computed attributes
        # Hard to debug which attributes are accessed
        return f"Computed {name}"

obj = DynamicAttributes()
result = obj.some_attribute  # Which attributes are being accessed?
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
class DynamicAttributes:
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        print(f"Accessing {name}")  # Log attribute access
        return f"Computed {name}"

# For more detailed tracing
import inspect

class TracedDynamicAttributes:
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        # Get call stack information
        caller = inspect.currentframe().f_back
        filename = caller.f_code.co_filename
        line_number = caller.f_lineno
        
        print(f"Attribute {name} accessed from {filename}:{line_number}")
        return f"Computed {name}"
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not logging or tracing dynamic attribute access
- Overly complex __getattr__ methods
- Not providing debugging information for dynamic attributes
- Making attribute access behavior too magical

**Performance Implications:**
Adding logging to dynamic attribute access adds some overhead but is invaluable for debugging. Consider disabling detailed logging in production.

## 11. Decorators and Their Performance Implications

### 11.1 Decorator Performance Overhead

**Problem Statement:**
Decorators add function call overhead which can impact performance in hot paths. How can you optimize decorators for performance?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        import time
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function took {time.time() - start} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def fast_function():
    return sum(range(1000))

# Called millions of times, the decorator overhead becomes significant
for _ in range(1000000):
    fast_function()
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
# Option 1: More efficient pure Python implementation
def timing_decorator(func):
    import time
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function took {time.time() - start} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Option 2: Using the C-based implementation from wrapt
import wrapt

@wrapt.decorator
def timing_decorator(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):
    import time
    start = time.time()
    result = wrapped(*args, **kwargs)
    print(f"Function took {time.time() - start} seconds")
    return result

@timing_decorator
def fast_function():
    return sum(range(1000))
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not considering decorator overhead for frequently called functions
- Importing modules inside wrapper functions
- Nested decorators creating multiple levels of function calls
- Not using C-based decorator implementations for critical code

**Performance Implications:**
Pure Python decorators add approximately 0.2-0.8 μs per call, which becomes significant for functions called millions of times. C-based implementations like wrapt reduce this overhead significantly.

### 11.2 Memoization Decorators

**Problem Statement:**
How can you use decorators to cache expensive function results efficiently?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Without memoization, expensive calculations are repeated
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Very slow for larger values of n
result = fibonacci(35)
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Much faster with memoization
result = fibonacci(35)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not using memoization for recursive functions
- Not setting appropriate cache sizes
- Using memoization for functions with side effects
- Using memoization for functions with large or unhashable arguments

**Performance Implications:**
Memoization can dramatically speed up repeated calls with the same arguments. For example, the recursive Fibonacci function goes from exponential to linear time complexity with memoization.

### 11.3 Conditionally Applied Decorators

**Problem Statement:**
How can you conditionally apply decorators based on runtime conditions, such as debug mode?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Decorator always applied, even when not needed
def debug_log(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with {args}, {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Result: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@debug_log
def compute_value(x, y):
    return x * y

# Debug logging happens even in production
result = compute_value(10, 20)
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import functools

# Create a configurable decorator
def debug_log(func=None, *, enabled=True):
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if enabled:
                print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with {args}, {kwargs}")
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                print(f"Result: {result}")
                return result
            else:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    
    # Handle both @debug_log and @debug_log(enabled=...)
    if func is None:
        return decorator
    return decorator(func)

# Set debug mode based on environment
DEBUG = False  # Would be True in development

@debug_log(enabled=DEBUG)
def compute_value(x, y):
    return x * y

# No debug logging in production
result = compute_value(10, 20)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Always applying decorators regardless of need
- Not making decorators configurable
- Complex decorator logic that runs unconditionally
- Not considering the performance impact in production

**Performance Implications:**
Conditionally applied decorators allow you to use powerful debugging and tracing in development while avoiding the performance overhead in production.

## 12. Context Managers for Resource Management

### 12.1 Custom Context Managers for Resource Cleanup

**Problem Statement:**
Resources like files, network connections, and locks need proper cleanup. How can you ensure resources are properly managed?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
def process_file(filename):
    # Resource might not be cleaned up on exceptions
    f = open(filename, 'r')
    data = f.read()
    result = process_data(data)  # If this raises an exception
    f.close()  # This might not be executed
    return result
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
def process_file(filename):
    # Using a context manager ensures cleanup
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()
        result = process_data(data)
    return result

# Creating a custom context manager
class TempFile:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        
    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, 'w')
        return self.file
        
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.file.close()
        import os
        os.remove(self.filename)
        
# Usage
with TempFile("temp.txt") as f:
    f.write("temporary data")
# File is automatically closed and removed after the block
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not using context managers for resource management
- Not handling exceptions in __exit__
- Not releasing resources in all code paths
- Nested context managers without proper cleanup

**Performance Implications:**
Proper resource management prevents resource leaks, which can degrade performance over time. Context managers ensure resources are released promptly, even when exceptions occur.

### 12.2 Implementing Context Managers with contextlib

**Problem Statement:**
Writing full classes for simple context managers is verbose. How can you simplify context manager creation?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Verbose class-based implementation
class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        import time
        self.start = time.time()
        return self
        
    def __exit__(self, *args):
        import time
        self.end = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {self.end - self.start} seconds")

# Usage
with Timer():
    perform_operation()
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def timer():
    import time
    start = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {end - start} seconds")

# Usage
with timer():
    perform_operation()
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using class-based context managers for simple cases
- Not using contextlib for single-purpose context managers
- Forgetting to handle exceptions in the context manager
- Not using finally to ensure cleanup code runs

**Performance Implications:**
Using contextlib.contextmanager adds minimal overhead compared to class-based context managers while making the code more readable and maintainable.

### 12.3 Reusable Context Managers

**Problem Statement:**
How can you create reusable context managers for common patterns like temporary resource management?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
# Duplicate code for similar context management tasks
def process_with_lock():
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        # Critical section
        perform_operation()
    finally:
        lock.release()

def another_locked_operation():
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        # Another critical section
        another_operation()
    finally:
        lock.release()
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def managed_resource(resource, acquire_method='acquire', release_method='release'):
    # Get the acquire/release methods
    acquire = getattr(resource, acquire_method)
    release = getattr(resource, release_method)
    
    # Acquire the resource
    acquire()
    try:
        yield resource
    finally:
        release()

# Usage for locks
with managed_resource(lock):
    perform_operation()

# Usage for files
with managed_resource(open('file.txt', 'r'), 'read', 'close') as data:
    process_data(data)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Duplicating context management code
- Not creating reusable abstractions
- Not handling resources consistently
- Forgetting to release resources in all code paths

**Performance Implications:**
Reusable context managers ensure consistent resource management across the codebase, reducing bugs and resource leaks that can impact performance.

## 13. Async/await and asyncio Debugging Challenges

### 13.1 Debugging asyncio Applications

**Problem Statement:**
Asyncio programs can be difficult to debug due to their non-sequential execution. How can you effectively debug asyncio code?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching {url}")
    # Simulate network request
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def process_urls(urls):
    tasks = []
    for url in urls:
        # Creating tasks but never awaiting them!
        task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(url))
        tasks.append(task)
    
    # Function returns without awaiting tasks
    return "Processing complete"

# Main function
async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com/1", "http://example.com/2"]
    result = await process_urls(urls)
    print(result)
    
    # Program ends before tasks complete
    # Tasks are silently abandoned

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching {url}")
    # Simulate network request
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def process_urls(urls):
    tasks = []
    for url in urls:
        task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(url))
        tasks.append(task)
    
    # Properly await all tasks
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

# Enable debug mode
async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com/1", "http://example.com/2"]
    result = await process_urls(urls)
    print(result)

# Run with debug mode enabled
asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgotten awaits (coroutines never executed)
- Tasks that are created but never awaited
- Not handling exceptions in async code
- Not enabling asyncio debug mode

**Performance Implications:**
Proper async code management ensures all tasks are completed and resources are properly utilized. Debug mode helps identify issues like unfinished tasks but adds some overhead.

### 13.2 Common asyncio Mistakes

**Problem Statement:**
Asyncio code has subtle pitfalls that can cause bugs or performance issues. What are common mistakes and how can you avoid them?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
import asyncio

async def slow_operation():
    # Blocking call in an async function
    import time
    time.sleep(1)  # This blocks the entire event loop!
    return "Result"

async def main():
    # Create many tasks
    tasks = [slow_operation() for _ in range(100)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import asyncio

async def slow_operation():
    # Non-blocking sleep using asyncio
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Result"

async def main():
    # Create tasks with concurrency limit
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)  # Limit concurrency
    
    async def bounded_slow_operation():
        async with semaphore:
            return await slow_operation()
    
    # Create many tasks with bounded concurrency
    tasks = [bounded_slow_operation() for _ in range(100)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using blocking calls in async code (time.sleep instead of asyncio.sleep)
- Not limiting concurrency with semaphores
- Not handling exceptions in async code
- Creating too many tasks without bounds

**Performance Implications:**
Blocking calls in asyncio code can stall the entire event loop, preventing other tasks from running. Proper async code with concurrency limits ensures efficient resource usage.

### 13.3 Debugging Task Cancellation

**Problem Statement:**
Task cancellation in asyncio can lead to resource leaks if not handled properly. How can you ensure resources are properly released when tasks are cancelled?

**Code Sample with Issue:**
```python
import asyncio

async def process_data(data):
    # Open a resource
    resource = await open_resource()
    
    try:
        # Process data
        result = await long_operation(resource, data)
        return result
    finally:
        # Close the resource
        await close_resource(resource)

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(process_data(large_data))
    
    # Later, cancel the task
    task.cancel()
    
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Task was cancelled")
```

**Correct Solution:**
```python
import asyncio

async def process_data(data):
    # Open a resource
    resource = await open_resource()
    
    try:
        # Process data
        result = await long_operation(resource, data)
        return result
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        # Handle cancellation specifically
        print("Operation cancelled, cleaning up")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception after cleanup
    finally:
        # Close the resource in all cases
        await close_resource(resource)

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(process_data(large_data))
    
    # Later, cancel the task
    task.cancel()
    
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("Task was cancelled and resources were cleaned up")
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not handling CancelledError in async code
- Not cleaning up resources on cancellation
- Re-raising exceptions improperly
- Not using finally blocks for cleanup

**Performance Implications:**
Proper cancellation handling prevents resource leaks and ensures that resources are released promptly, even when tasks are cancelled.
